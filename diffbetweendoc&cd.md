Kubernetes came up with container Runtime Interface ( CRI) that allow any conatiner storing system to run in kubernetes until they follow the OCI( Open Container Initiative) standards 

#### instead of docker run commands 

we could use 

$ nerdctl run commands


### CLI - crictl commands 

$ crictl 

$ crictl pull busybox

$ crictl images 

$ crictl ps -a

$ crictl logs 

$ crictl pods
